There was no need for the mother to die in the first sentence of this novel, nor for the father to be a drunk. Let's use a little imagination, you writers! Why couldn't the scenario have the father in a positive role, perhaps teaching the children about the land, when some accident happens, leaving them to fend for themselves. And why don't any of the editorial reviewers mention this tiresome sterotyping? Please do not buy this book.\n",

In this case, we're talking fiction -- there's an awful lot of non-fiction to be collected properly, yet -- and so it's mystifying why so much of this fairly slim anthology is Lardner's mediocre work. Where are such great stories as \"I Can't Breathe\" or (arguably) \"Haircut\"? Also, why excerpt so much of YOU KNOW ME AL when it's either best read cover to cover or represented with two or three pieces (to whet the appetite) and then moving on?The earlier collection assembled by Lardner, ROUND UP, is far, far better than this. This great writer's books have all but disappeared from most bookstores; with a collection like this carrying his flag, it's no wonder why someone might simply shrug and ask what, exactly, is the big deal?This should rate two and a half stars -- not an option here.\n",

DVD extras can only bring light to Ellsberg's ostracizing, and Nixon's paranoia.Domestically, Nixon was OK; he just didn't know how to deal with the world at large. Nothing was said about Ford ending the war and pardoning Nixon, which I thought was a smart move; let's be glad it was all OVER! No more baggage to burden the taxpayers.Highly recommended.\n",

When I saw the film Mr. Ellsberg spoke afterward about what we had seen, what many of us remembered about the time, and what was still missing from the story just presented to us. Good as the movie is - and it deserves to be seen widely as an example of how individual choices and individual courage can inspire change - the movie that could have been is even greater.\n",

You also have to be competent at both \"wire and panel\" and through-hole PCB soldering. You should also have basic test equipment, not only a good multimeter but a signal source-not a guitar!!- a dummy load, and at least a signal tracer but preferably an oscilloscope of some sort. For a lot of reasons, I tend to judge technicians by how competent they are with an oscilloscope, the overwhelmingly single most important test instrument.

That said, these twelve arrangements of some of my favorite country songs are really lame. When I first heard about this CD of Willie with the Texas Troubadors, I thought it would surely be a gem, but even the likes of Buddy Charleton (steel) and Leon Rhodes (guitar) can't save this 1965 turkey. The songs all sound either too fast or too slow to me. The arrangements are dated in the worst sense of the word.

Although Kesey supposidly wrote about his feelings about society and government, I highly doubt that he knew anything that was going on while he was writing the book. He wrote most of the book while on LSD or peyote which explains why the book is a jumble of thoughts and words put together to look like sentences. In all, this novel should not be considered a classic at all, but a drug induced hallucination put into words!\n",

Since my dad's balance is also not great, I had to demonstrate how to step onto the scale and instructed him to hold onto the sink or grab bar while doing it.

This movie was such a let-down and really did not fit in with any of the series. It was hardly about Ed & Al at all, and Mustang and his group were almost not in it. It could have been an episode of any anime, because it really was FMA in name only. I can't believe I was actually longing for humunculi, or *anything* to make it feel more like FMA to me. Amazingly bloody, ridiculously convoluted plotline, original characters that kept popping out of the woodworks that I couldn't have cared less about.

In deciding to make an FMA: Brotherhood feature length movie, there was some serious potential for making a badass, excellent addition to the anime. Instead of adding more to the FMA: Brotherhood storyline, they go completely off on a tangent for this one, with a storyline that is 100% unrelated to the anime. I had about a million ideas of awesome things that could have been done with this movie, perhaps involving Xing and alkahestry, as those were relatively unexplored in the anime, but still had a central role in the storyline. Any of seemingly infinite possibilities of awesomeness existed, but whoever thought this was the best route to go was defintely off their rocker.\n",

Further, there is a fair amount of clipping during the more intense parts which is disappointing because Vu is one of my favs. It is the current practice to raise the average volume of music to as close as possible to maximum so it sounds louder to a listener and music people think that this will get peoples attention. But the processes used are damaging to the sound quality and leads to listening fatigue. Besides, most people know how to work the volume knob (or replaygain/etc) so when something is markedly louder than what was before, people either skip it or turn down the volume.Google loudness war for more info.

I think the major drawback of this book is the lack of cases (there are only a few, with more emphasis on policies) which would definitely make the read much more entertaining.I do not necessarily agree with Netanyahu's politics, but I found in this book a fresh source of ideas, with no political leanings.\n",

This book is more appropriate for a novice with no knowledge of, and just a passing interest in, the subject. I agree with some of the other critiques, this writing is based more on opinion, with some historical facts, than a serious study of extremism and terrorist organizations. A big part of the turmoil in the Middle East is brought about by the Israel/Palestinian issue - unless this is settled, terrorism will persist in one form or another for generations. Netanyahu does not do an adequate job of addressing this subject from a neutral perspective. In short, he is not a disinterested or neutral observer - he obviously has an agenda. The reader must keep this in mind when reading. Not recommended.\n",

Benjamin Netanyahu is an intelligent, well educated man who clearly knows that which he writes about. He knows what needs to be done with terrorism because he lives with it. However this book makes me sad. It's barely been three years since September 11th and we have gotten so involved in pointing fingers at one particular person or one particular ideology that we have forgotten the point. I do not know that America and the rest of the \"developed world\" will ever deal adequately with the threat that terrorists pose because we as a society do not want to know that others view us as less than human. This book points out that terrorism cannot be justified because it is evil. If only we would remember that. READ THIS BOOK!!!\n",

He gets right to the point in the forward, written after Sept. 11th: \"What is at stake today is nothing less than the survival of our civilization.\"This book points out the dangers that now lurk throughout the world, within America, and within our own cities. It boldly takes on topics of terrorist education, training, psychology, philosophy, amorality, and barbarism, and backs up all conclusions with hard facts and inside information.The final chapter, \"What is to be done,\" gives a terrific ten-step blueprint for fighting terrorism, the majority of which it appears President Bush is now following.

He says that people shouldn't demand unconditional love, shouldn't have unrealistic expectations, and his general point seems to be that people should (must) work for their happiness.Actually, his point about holding no expectations was actually the most interesting part of the book. But, this book does not do the \"problem of happiness\" much justice. Prager fails to realize that there are millions of people unlike him who are happy people, many people do not find happiness in the way he has decreed as the only \"true\" way possible. Prager's arrogant claims that a secular family can't really be grateful for anything and that divine retribution leads to human happiness are just plain childish and untrue.For a better treatment of happiness, read \"The Conquest of Happiness\" by Bertrand Russell\n",

            "Review: delightful \"downstairs\" Regency......: another enjoyable addition to Marion Chesney's long list of funny, witty, and romantic \"old school\" style Regency romances.The quite different but very entertaining aspect of this book, and this series, is that half of the story is about the servants in the house that has been let. Miss Chesneys forte' of introducing complex and fun secondary characters shines in this book. Chesney's subtle wit is present in both the upper echelon and the staff. I look forward to reading future books of this series to learn more of the servants \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" misadventures.As to the romance in this story. Fiona was a great heroine-a foundling who learned quickly in life to hide her intelligence, because society frowns upon \"bluestockings\", and the good hearted albeit snobbish Earl an excellent change of pace.Another great novel by Chesney and highly recommended. 5 stars.\n",

As most of us who must stay gluten free do, I went over in my mind what I had had to eat the day before and these rolls were the only new thing. I then researched garbanzo beans. They are in the soybean family. My doctor has told me that I must also be careful of soy as well as milk unless it is lactose free. The garbanzo beans were the problem so I had to go to another brand with the other types of flour. If you don't have a problem with soy, the rolls were very good. Wonderful taste and very soft.

I could easily relate to the abuse story line, having lived that myself as a child. As a gay father, I can relate VERY well to John and to Henry as they learned more about what being a parent is all about. I did find quite a few words that sent me scurrying for my dictionary - a bit frustrating but liveable. I did have to get some help with the spanish words, very few were written so the reader could figure the meaning of the word based on context. Overall, a great book, and now I need to go find the rest of the Rios series. I'm hooked! Have read Goldenboy also.\n",

This latest was well worth the wait! The characters in all of Nava's Henry Rios series are so well drawn: three-dimensional, flawed, lovable. The life experiences they encounter as human beings enveloped in crime solving always show them to be people you would want to know personally. Nava's writing makes you believe you have.I'm very sorry to hear that this is the last of the Rios series and must join in with those who are hoping that we might still have more in the future.

Nava brings a level of sophistication to his books, with believable, developed characters and sharp prose. I first encountered Nava in an anthology of articles by prominent gay writers based on their coming out experiences. I was impressed then by his story and his writing.

His niece's son Angel ends up living with Henry, as Henry also begins dating again. This is a great example of the movement in recent gay fiction toward family- and relationship-oriented stories.

With Miso soupls in particular, I have noticed that unless the packaging does not say 'No MSG\" in big bold letters on the front of the package, the soup contains MSG. This brand is no exception. I like the taste and was enjoying it for quite a few years until I have made this discovery. No MSG Miso soups exist but are harder to find. I usually go to specialized Asian markets to get them. This brand is the most commercially available Miso soup on the market. It's a shame that it is not the healthiest choice for those who care about what they eat.\n",

Anyone new to Kabbalah would be totally lost by the subject matter discussed in this book. I thought the drawing looked like something out of a high school art class. I would recommened to anyone getting into Kabbalah to start off with Power of Kabbalah by Rav Berg instead. This book is great as a resource tool once you got more into Kabbalah.\n",

First, the reason I bought the book was because of a review I read here on Amazon. Everything that person said in his review was true and accurate. I have read many other books on Kabbalah, but this one is different. It's written in dialogue, so I automatically became wrapped up in the relationship between the Rabbi and Neer. They are two very likeable people and their fondness for each other adds a unique emotional dimension to the book. I could really feel the affection and respect they had for one another. A few of the chapters I had to read twice, but overall, the book is very readable. The Rabbi uses common-sense analogies to get his points across and it's hard to argue with his comparisons between the physical and spiritual worlds. Again, it's the engrossing dialogue that makes this book work so well.\n",

There are many students who attend my classes who have been misled by certain Kabbalah organizations and this book helps to set them straight. Some of these Kabbalah organizations have a a 'cult-like' following and their members purposely slander excellent Kabbalah books like this one. Not only does this book explain the wisdom of Kabbalah, but there are also beautiful illustrations from The Kabbalah Art Museum in Zefat, Israel.

Other books seem to be several inches over my head in understanding. I picked up his book after his lecture and have not been disappointed yet. The book is in the same straight-forward speak that he uses in his lectures. It breaks down complex thoughts and ideas and presents them to you in a way that's easy to digest, and leaves you wanting more. This is a great first step on the path to understanding Kabbalah. I'm just disappointed that he didn't include his Wizard of Oz analogy in the book (that I've seen yet -- still have a little longer to finish) -- where he compares the characters Dorothy meets on her way to the Emerald City as representations of the 4 Kingdoms on Earth (mineral, plant, animal, human = Tin Man, Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Dorothy).\n",

The errors are subtle but can mislead a beginning programmer very easily.A few glaring examples are the book implies (and a diagram shows) that http traffic is routed through DNS servers, claims that html tags require attributes when they do not, and skipping important concepts like named anchors with in a document. The book also makes claims about browser behavior that is not correct. (Browsers can't handled x-??? mime types without the server providing a program via some magical unnamed system)It appears as if the author of the book has only the most cursory knowledge of what he is writing about.

People tend to forget that beneath the glitz and sexual references is a story of amazing depth, and one of the funnest scores in recent Broadway history. The show deals with a young man trying to find his place in the world, and the troubles many of his new interests bring. The title character is played with zest by John Rubinstein, but the show belongs to Ben Vereen, who stops the show with all his numbers, especially \"Magic to Do,\" and \"Simple Joys.\" Special note must also go to Irene Ryan (of \"The Beverly Hillbilies\") as Pippin's grandmother, who gets my favorite song: \"No Time at All.\" \"Pippin\" is no masterpiece, but it's a lot of fun for all.\n",

Not only is the sound quality crystal-clear, but the liner notes provide lots of insight into each song and the entire show itself.

The trials and tribulations of the family dealing with Marc's emotional/mental/physical issues takes up most of the film. It's very interesting to watch, though painful at times.

I was truly hoping for some insight and guidance around answering the tough questions... especially because I tend to be introspective and thoughtful and find it difficult at times to articulate a quick response.I did not find that in this book. I found the examples too obscure and contrary to the point being made (many of the political speech examples just didn't seem to exemplify the advice being given.) And I found myself getting stuck in trying to figure out what Roman Pillars had to do with anything...I was disappointed and hope to find a book that actually resonates with me.\n",

The scariest scenes are of a few seconds of seeing someone getting an injection and then feigning a heart attack. You'll get a greater thrill from just going to the hospital for an injection of saline (salt water) solution. The movie's writer must never have heard of forensics; needle marks; position of the body; security cameras, autopsies; weird coincidences and patterns and background checks, etc. A California divorce court would be a safer way to gain financial independence. Boringly predictable ending of bad girl dies and nice girl gets the boss and a position upgrade in the company.Even relative to it's comparable genre of TV romance soaps, this movie just doesn't hold up.\n",

It was really clever how Monica Ferris found a way to keep all of the suspects from leaving the scene of the crime,and how she involved Jill, a policewoman way out of her jurisdiction, in helping to solve this whodunit.I would have given this story five stars, were it not for the little \"hiccups\" in continuity and spelling. There were times when whole sentences were left out, names were misspelled, and even a time when the name of a suspect changed to the name of the dead woman!

Crewel Yule certainly meets those criteria. But except for its very lengthy, mostly tedious descriptions of various needlework plans and patterns, there really isn't much to it. The dozens of crafters who make up most of the cast are stereotypical housewife types, and Betsy's 2 best friends are caricatures, one of a swishy gay man (Goddy) and one of a capable female cop who is apparently willing to work without pay. The reader is forced to listen to her explanation of what she is doing every time she interviews a suspect. And the motives of the various suspects are repeated more times than I could count. Except for the murderer and victim, everyone is so nice. I enjoy various types of needlework, including crossstitch and crewel, but didn't find much to enjoy in this tale, especially not the commercials.\n",

After reading it, I have a hard time understanding why many people gave this book 4-5 stars. Granted, there were some good ideas in the book and the writing style was engaging at at times. However, there was a large portion of the book that focused on the need for positive attitude in a sales career and the means by which to ensure that such good attitude is maintained.

Unfortunately, such unscholarly perspectives relegate this book to something less than the \"chamber of commerce\"-style inspirational book, \"Lincoln on Leadership\".

If you are interested in the period, you might also read Reilly, Ace of Spies and books by or about spymaster Bruce Lockheart.\n",

This is a practical book. Houle reviews a history of program design along with five case studies that illustrate the model that he proposes. His model presents a detailed analysis of 11 categories of possible educational activities along with the details of his 7-step system of program design. This book is well-written and practical. His focus ranges from the individual program to mass audiences. I especially like the chapter on \"Mastering a Personal System of Practice\" which helps the reader translate the system into a useful and practical one.

Maybe if I had 2 young cats I would be less concerned, but as it stands, there is no way I will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back. I still have the packages from the last order I bought, and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients.

The movie is a cult classic, but unlike many other cult classics, \"Night of the Creeps\" is actually a very good movie. The movie is genuinely funny when it is supposed to be, and genuinely scary when it intends to be.

            "Review: lesser Limits: This is one of the poorer episodes in the series. The claim that it is one of the most unsettling is probably due to the \"attachment\" procedure that the title creatures use to enter the bodies of their human hosts. It reminded me of the way John Hurt was \"hosted\" in the film Alien. However having this procedure didn't seem to change the behaviour of Don Gordon who behaves the same way before and after. Perhaps the way it effected George MacReady and Neil Hamilton (later to appear in TV's Batman) was to make them act over-the-top. This is particularly unsettling for MacReady, who's voice is in opposition to this kind of performance. (Who can forget him in Gilda with Rita Hayworth). His teeth are also noticeably odd here. Was he wearing dentures? There is also a surprising homoerotic subtext to this episode which I'm sure is unintentional.\n",

Now with the rerelease of what is astetically a greatest hits collection, he should be discovered by generations to come. He prolonged the seduction. He stretched out the verbal foreplay until there was nothing to do but the physical act. And the songs were foreplay on their own. \"It's Esctasy When You Lie Next To Me\",\"Staying Power\", and the true classic\"Can't get Enough of your Love,Babe\" are just testaments to this man's musical genius and his love of love.

While all the other blueprints of the tv homes features do look like they were drawn by a professional, the two pages devoted to the drawings of the Jupiter 2 look very crudely drawn, as if the author never even bothered to watch the series. Not only the blueprints for the Jupiter 2 is wrong, but so is the JEtsons, MASH,Gilligan's Island, and many many others. I can't believe this book is STILL in print being so inaccurate.

And One viewing (episode) of the Dick Van Dyke show revealed a dozen errors in Petrie home. Likewise, the Andy Taylor home is badly skewed. I don't expect this author to be an architect, and I understand that sets are sets, not houses or towns. I do however expect him to get right the things that are evident in nearly every episode, like the layout of Mayberry's streets and the positions of living room walls. As a writer and illustrator, I am saddened by the dedication to being pretty and the lack of effort to be correct. Most reviewers here seem to prefer pretty to correct. It's up to you which one you prefer. These diagrams are good as a rough idea upon which to build and correct (except for the Mayberry map, which you'd be better off beginning again from scratch), and as such are to me not worth the price.\n",

I particularly liked his critique of religion: \"I have seen a mother die painfully of cancer, a father's personality destroyed by Alzheimer's, and scores of relatives murdered in the Holocaust.

The majority of the models used in the book are professional bodybuilders who have used huge amounts of steroids, yet no mention is made of this aid to gaining strength and mass.The exercise descriptions are simplistic and the anatomy is occaisionally incorrect.Good quality research has demonstrated that the many of the diet and supplement reccomendations made here are of no or limited effectiveness.I returned the book immediately.\n",

In doing so, they have muddled the waters. They lose you (at least they did me) in all the definitions, classifications, descriptions, explanations, and reasons. Plus, they are promoting their products. (I guess I can't blame them for that.) It is not a bad book for those that are really serious about strength training. The information is there for those who are meticulous enough to extrapolate it and dedicated enough to put it t use. For those people, I give the book 4 ? stars.

As such, it is our responsibility as parents to make ourselves emotionally healthy so that we can provide a stable and nurturing environment for our kids. Great idea, but for me, the weakness of the book is a failure to provide practical ideas for how best to execute. I think this attachment-style of parenting too often results in selfish and self-centered children who have little respect for adults or others. On the other hand, Jim Fay's \"Parenting With Love and Logic : Teaching Children Responsibility\" is easy to read and provides instruction on meaningful ways to interact with children so that they grow up feeling loved and being responsible for their own behavior.\n",

The information in this book is sparse at best and advocates an ultra conservative style of play. While most authors rightly suggest a tight-aggresive style of play, some of this author's suggestions seem to be a bit extreme and often are not consistent. For example in the practice hand section, which takes up 9 of the book's 27 pages, the author suggests that with a pair of Aces over fives after four cards one should bet the maximum but fold if you are raised, but in the same section says that with a pair of kings over fives after four cards one should raise to the maximum and then fold if someone re-raises you.

Paulos: a great mind.: The author deals in an original way with the difficult nexus between statistics and stories, between alpha- and betascience, without favouring one of them, and indeed arguing that both are complementary. This striking impartiality creates the space for original ideas about everyday-situations that every reader will certainly recognize. To be original about (seeming) banality, that is the work of a true great mind. The reason why I do not rate this book with the maximum score, is that it sometimes misses an overarching line of reasoning. The discursive path may strike some readers (like me) as too associative. Needless to say that such a style has its charms, but perhaps due to my Europe-continental education, I am a bit more at ease with a clear thesis and a transparant construction.

Aesthetically, however, his ethos is that of Tschykovsky and Borodin. And here is the key: Borodin was deeply influenced by Mendelsohn. The result is that Gliere's chamber music for strings--while having Russian inflections--largely reflects Mendelsohn's muse.With such a combination, one can scarcely go wrong!\n",

Some one should tell the writer/director that it takes more than famous names on the marquee to make a successful film. A good story line would have helped. It was never made clear as to who was the protagonist and who the antagonist.

They played their parts well, but I think the director was a little...misguided. The first third of the movie makes sense for the most part, keeping in line with the expected Western vendetta-chase. And then it turns into this really weird introspective/metaphorical/symbolic....thing. Ultimately I was left thinking, \"...what did I just watch?\"Another review said there were some small parts played well, and that's true. But over all, I don't think this was worth my time, which really makes me sad because, come on: Neeson and Brosnan in one movie? Maybe it was just too much awesome for one director to handle well.\n",

The opening sequences and subsequent escape of Brosnans character from the opening scene was indeed memorable, and the filmography stunning, but you're immediately asking the question of 'why does (Neeson) want so desperately to hunt down and kill (Brosnan)?'. This question goes unanswered for the majority of the movie, and once it's made known that the two were former war rivals and an accident takes the life of Neesons family (for which he blames Brosnan), the motivation is unsatisfying. I had absolutely no empathy with Neeson's character, who is apparently hell bent for misplaced revenge over nothing more than bad judgement, not malice. I was left with a feeling of 'that's it?' when trying to understand Neesons motive, and the ending was so anticlimactic as to render this movie utterly forgettable.\n",

Nick takes one two many guitar solos,sometimes 2 or three are multitracked, all going at once, but the tunes are great psychedelia and very DIY. Warning to tech-heads, this is really lo-fi, noisy,home 4 track, trash can drum sound stuff. He went digital 8 track a couple of years ago, but this stuff is early, before that enlightenment. The rumor is that Nick Saloman started home recording with money he got from a car accident. His guitar sound is pure late 60's psych freakout like SRC, Hendrix and George Brigman,the later whose records are also sonically comparable to The Frond. See Bevis live if you get a chance, it'll be the show you'll talk about for awhile.

We shouldn't worry about social justice because poverty doesn't have anything to do with the distribution of resources, it is 100% the fault of the poor themselves. Just like the above review says, Michael Milken didn't get rich by committing massive fraud and robbing people blind, he got rich because he's so frugal he deigned to drive a station wagon.You'll enjoy this book if you need a dose of Ayn Randian propaganda.\n",

            "Review: The end of the Amazon Trio *cries*: This DVD has the last of the Amazon Trio, very sad ending for them as well. But a happy ending is in store. FishEye realizes that he, Tiger, and Hawk dont have Dream Mirrors. Fisheye now wants to have beautiful dreams after being rejected by Mamoru(Darien) and he ends up saving Sailor Moon by choosing to fix her dream mirror instead of becoming human. Tiger tells Fisheye that they should do it right and be human from the start. They then die.....but wait! Pegasus retores the Trio and gives them what they wished for.....dream mirrors! Then they are taken away to Elysion until all evil is gone.The most tragic ending I've ever seen, (I cried more for the Trio's death then Usagi's death in the R movie) But this DVD also has the happiest ending in which the Trio finally become human. And for all you Amazoness Quartet fanatics, the Amazoness Quartet saga beings on this DVD.Very recommeded DVD! Buy it!\n",

I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the poor quality of reproductions. It's a cheap book, I get it---but wow. The image quality is about as good a 10 cent black and white copy you'd get from the library copy machine. The delicacy is missing. The luminous quality which makes his work so stunning, brilliant, and unearthly is completely absent. I guess what was most disappointing is how vacant and lifeless the work appears. I really can't believe it.Even though there aren't a lot of books available on Redon, but I'm pretty certain this particular one will be returned. I find no joy looking through it. I should have known better than to purchase a $15 art book. I have ordered, but have yet to receive, the Redon book \"As In Dream\" and here's hoping it's not a let down, too.\n",

I have made the Peanut \"Better\" Cookies, Double Chocolate-Almond Explosion Cookies, and the Fudgy Brownies, and they were all delicious and had great texture. I promise you can not tell the difference between these and butter & eggs recipes. I also made the Chipotle Veggie-Bean Burritos (alas, woman cannot live on cookies alone) and they were great.

The only thing that isn't readily available is hemp seed nuts, but I've substituted other nuts with no problems. The Lenitil Sunflower Pie is particularly good--its on my regular rotation of meals now. I only wish this book was longer--but I will definitely check out other of Dreena Burton's books.\n",

I also appreciate that many of her recipes are wheat free, as I like the nutritional value from diverse grains. But best of all, the recipes are simple to make and they are simply scrumptious!

Although Beckey is undoubtably a climbing guru around these parts, I have never associated his name with Rainier. As for the other author, I am sure he is quite qualified at writing a guide for the one route he \"sheepherds\" clients up in the summer, but heck I could regurgitate route descriptions from other books also.

That care is reflected in this book. There is generous use of maps and photgraphs that bring the route descriptions alive. It's almost as if you are \"right there\" on the mountain. Using red tracings for the routes on top of the photographs really highlights the routes. I especially liked the little tidbits from other climbers and extra \"safety tips\" about what to watch out for on certain routes. It goes well beyond the standard guide book. I have several guide books that include Rainier, but this is far and away the most complete. It is a welcome and valued addition to my library.\n",

If you're new to this kind of work, a good place to start would be Calvin Hall's Primer of Jungian Psychology.Excellent companions to Anatomy would be Jung on Active Imagination, edited by Chodorow, and Jung's own Memories, Dreams and Reflections, or Man and His Symbols.Edinger's book would also be a smart buy for anyone practicing pathworking or other spiritual techniques that make extensive use of imagination. If this is your thing, another great companion text would be Alchemy & Mysticism: the Hermetic Museum, by Roob. That book is a peerless collection of alchemical images.

Also, I'm always interested in reading books based in Thailand that AREN'T about the sex trade, prostitutes and the fat farang who has a bar girl girlfriend.Lapcharoensap is interesting in that, for all intents and purposes, he was brought up in the US, so he's writing more as a Westerner looking at Thailand than he is as a Thai. His dialogue, for instance, is not written the way Thais actually speak but instead sounds more like Americans speaking. That for me was the weak point of the stories. Having said that though, his prose is nice, and I think he's very talented. I look forward to reading more of his work, especially his upcoming novel.I'm giving the book 4 stars though for really no other reason than that it's written by a Thai writer, and there aren't very many of them writing in English.\n",

It's truly a playlist and the soundtrack often underscores and exceeds the story, taking over the film in quite a few places. The film is cutsey at times and entirely gross at others, without reason to be either. There's one running joke that's filthy disgusting and boggles the mind of any audience member as to why it was included in this teenybopper film.\n",

Confusing, I know. I found the book to be much better than the movie. I can appreciate where the movie is trying to go but there was much less substance than the book. I did like how the movie portrayed the character of Norah. She seems just as genuine as her character in the book; however, I feel Nick's character got short-changed in the movie in favor of focusing on the supporting characters who played very minor roles in the book but were giving more screen time than necessary. Overall, if I saw this movie without ever even knowing about the book, I would have found it cute and endearing but having read the book, I was left wanting more.\n",

I also don't particularly like Christian fiction romances because they are usually boring and drawn out, but this novel is unlike any other Christian romance book that I have read. True enough it is a story about faith, trust and love, but it should be named something like \"Love is in the Airlines,\" because that is where her heart lead her to find true romance (and let me tell you that he was a GOOD find). But from the beginning, Marley had suspicions about her fiance. The book was predictable but it was a quaint story. MaGrand was a big hit. She was one grandmother who spoke from her fists--and if the punch landed on your face--then so be it. Marley's friends fitted in the story as fill-ins. Christian romance writers need to use this book as a model. Jamellah Ellis kept it real and exciting. I recommend this book to all Christians especially women and non-Christian women.\n",

The second I opened the package, the scent of cloves hit my nose, and the clove taste in the brewed tea was even stronger. Not my thing! The cloves totally smothered the cardamom, ginger and tea flavors.In short: Great company, but only buy this if you love cloves!Because the tea is small, you'll want a fine filter.

These books are set in and around Annapolis with the most sympathetic of heroines: Hannah Ives, a fifty-ish dynamo who is just recovering from a mastectomy (I think this was covered in a previous book but I seem to have come into the middle of the series). This book deals with the fact and fiction behind the repressed memory craze that shook the US ten-ish years ago. What I like best about this book is Hannah's wacky family and how real the family dynamics seem to be. It is a little stiffly plotted and some of the coincidences are a little too handy, but I really like the setting and Hannah and her wonderful husband, so I think I'll go back for another helping or two.\n",

Other German cookbooks contain long and complicated recipes with sometimes confusing techniques and conversions. This one is so incredibly basic that its more of a book of concepts.

I made one cake recipe and spent a lot of money on ingredients and it was the most tasteless thing I've ever baked; extremely disappointed. I realize the author states somewhat of a disclaimer telling us she's an amateur but this is still poorly done and her editors really let her down. I cannot recommend it.\n",

The book works on a number of levels: as a laugh-out-loud tale of an innocent abroad; as an insider look at a Soviet Union that no longer exists; and as a poignant rumination on families and the past. Goldstein is particularly adept at capturing the absurdities of the situations in which he finds himself, whether it is seeking something to eat on the train or trying to get a room at a hotel where he is not due until the next day and thus does not exist. Thank god that Goldstein was willing to take this trip on the reader's behalf, because God knows I wouldn't want to do it. But I'm sure glad he did and chose to write about it.\n",

Guy loses family, goes out for revenge, discovers a large plot by an evil corporation to rule the world... What's new? If you've played one action game you've played them all. Once you figure out how to kill one bad guy, you can kill them all. I don't see why everyone thinks this is the greatest game ever, its been done before.\n",

It's got good graphics and I can see that alot of time was obviously spent on the storyline and accompanying graphics. However, for my part I like games that concentrate on the action versus the cutscenes. It seems like you kill three enemies, find some ammo and painkillers and then have to wait through another cutscene. Yeah, the graphics are good, my compliments. But I'd rather have a game that's more fun to play versus worrying about how many bullets and shell casings get drawn in a particular room.\n",

And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony, but it's a very short one, too...you can finish it the same day you receive it.Suffice it to say Max Payne is just poor value all round. It's obvious most of the reviewers here either don't have the game or reviewed it while still in their 10-hour honeymoon with it.

First off the game overall is one of the best shooters I have ever played. The reason for this is because the story and action are so perfectly intertwined with one another that the game comes off as almost flawless. Remedy decided to take the shooter genre to new hights by adding inovating gameplay, including the awesome Matrix Style slow mo. The graphics and sound of Max Payne are amazing. Its really cool how they take peoples faces and litterally put them onto the characters.

I ran up the stairs to see if my wife and kid were okay, thats when I heard the screams. Someone was hurting my family. My heart started to race and the door to the bedroom wouldnt open..all i heard was my wife's terrified voice screaming Max!! Than in a New York Minute my family was killed...by some druggies. After disposing of the killers...the emptiness filled my heart and my soul. And this was only the first few minutes of one of the most revolutionary games of all time. Both graphically and sound amazing Max Payne grips you without remorse. The gameplay is great with the \"bullettime effect\" becoming a zen strategic move that helps you uncover the truth.

It is the closest you will ever get to starring in a John woo movie. The slow-motion bullet time does not remind me of the matrix. It remindes me of an 80's B movie called \"TRANCERS\" a clone of the terminator, Starring Helen Hunt. In that film the bad guy fires his gun at helen hunt and the hero (i dont remember who) presses a button in his watch and it slows down time, Then he pushes helen hunt before the bullet reaches her, You could see the bullet go past her. The guy is from the future to save helen hunt from getting killed before she saves the future, Just like the terminator. His watch could give him a long second, One second takes one minuite to pass through only for him. This movie came much before the matrix. It must have inspired the bullet sence in the matrix too.\n",

The in-game graphics were FAR better than anything Half Life or Deus Ex. This, unlike so many other games that seem to scream trhough development, never gave me any trouble, had any bugs, or even ran catchy. Silky smooth all the way through. The biggest thing I loved about this game was the lack of aliens or demons.

The gameplay is alo well done ,it's a bit like hitman ,you run and use things with your keyboard and you aim with your mouse and shoot with your mouse . The downside of this game are the cutscenes , as good as the in game graphics are as bad are the cutscenes ,hey are just comicbook pictures!with a bad voice over just ripped from an old B gangster movie. But all in all it's a fresh new shooting game . a real recommendation!!!\n",

I was almost certain that he must have been a deep thinker, complex, narcissistic and abstract, but he was the opposite really -although somewhat obstinate.This book gives you an understanding of this man's training, perseverance and pride as a stage and screen actor. It sheds some light on his long road from poverty to immortality. How he continuously worked gaining recognition and fame through tough years, how he snubbed Hollywood for most of his life and still became a movie icon to be reckoned with.The book contains some laughable anecdotes and interesting stories about Marcello's journey.

I suspect they wrote this book switching genders, with Bull writing the man and Brust writing the woman. They do not ring true and the sex scene was simply embarrassing on all accounts and definitely sounded like it was written by a man. Sad and unfortunate, and I found the ending contrived and trite. I won't spoil it for people who wish to read this anyway, but suffice to say that this was the first novel I've read from either writer that came across as hackneyed and cliche.

But while I was at the bookstore I ran across the others and eagerly read them all. In my opinion, Eagle Strike is the best of them, drawing from the other books but unique in its own way. I was exetremely happy to see Yassen Gregorovich back again, since I had an odd fascination with him, but the ending was a letdown for me---not saying anymore about that!Though this book was hard to relate to-how many kids can say they saved the world?-it was interesting and oddly believable! Also, the age category is 9-12, but anyone older than that can thoroughly enjoy it, as I did.

I don't mind amateurish, but these films are, without a single exception, simply bad. They vary from pointless and random to nauseatingly violent without any plot or suspense. The first film on the disc, \"True Love\" is actually cute and worth watching; I would use it as an example of how bad quality sound can ruin an otherwise okay film. The other films on this disc I wouldn't even show to my students as bad examples of what to avoid, because most of them are just unwatchable and/or offensive. Usually when I review a disc, I like to say something nice about it... my reviews as a rule tend to the \"glowing\" side.

My mom bought me the book because I grew up in the same town and had swimming lessons with Kathryn's mom...this was in the early 1970's, before she was born. We have never met, and I hope to meet her someday. This saga was inspiring and has motivated me to finally get my life-story down on paper. She has given us a clear story of growing up in a world with mixed messages and stressful expectations. She was determined to reach for her goals and unfortunately it was bittersweet in the end.\n",

By miracles I do not mean your favorite football team pulling out a victory by a last second pass, or a near miss accident, or a remarkably quick healing of an illness. A real miracle is a violation or suspension of the natural laws of science. Some liberal theologians believe that God would be wrong to do this. Most agnostics and atheists as well as modernists do not believe in miracles at all. The miracles done by Jesus, as documented in the New Testament are often explained away by people with small faith and anti-supernatural agendas.

The authors have set out to prove their beliefs by totally ignoring any evidence to the contrary. This book reminds me of several written by UFO fanatics that create a world totally contrary to reality. Even though I tried to keep an open mind while reading this book, I found it difficult to imagine that any \"scholar\" could collect such biased references and attempt to pass them off as authoritative. Almost all the arguments in this book are flawed and totally discount reality or any of the science we have learned over the past 200 years.

One proverb states \"A fish cannot describe water until it is caught.\" It has a lot of depth but is a very light read. It is like \"chicken soup for the soul\" book series.

I purchased most of the individual commentaries by Dr. McGee and find them to be Biblically-sound and extremely understandable, edifying and uplifting. The downside of having all of those individual volumes is space. That's why I purchased the 5-volume set: to save some space.To clarify: if you are looking for a very academic exegetical commentary which delves into translation of Hebrew and Koine Greek words then this commentary set will not suit you. However for Christian laity like myself, Dr. McGee's commentary on the Bible is a very welcome and useful addition to my ever-expanding commentary collection.\n",

Vernon McGee for years and really like his work. For me, this commentary helps the Bible to come alive. This is the second set I have purchased. I bought this set to donate to an awsome new adult sunday school teacher.Product was in better condition than I anticipated. Shipping was exactly as advertised and arrived days before estimated shipping arrival date.\n",

And thank God for the internet, because...I can tune in to him anytime I want.This 5 volume commentary set digests some of his most helpful comments from his 5 year trip through the Bible. And in some passages, he is a wonderful help. And in other passages, he hardly says a word! So what this means for the preacher is that some Sundays, McGee will help you a lot, and on other Sundays, he won't help you at all. But the times he is helpful outweigh the times when he isn't, so I would still heartily recommend this set to your pastor.\n",

Then again, I wonder sometimes why the \" artistic crowd\" is so relentlesly drawn to portray the politicians like Stalin, Marx, Castro, Chavev, etc, in a positive light, when those people would jail or kill them for any misstep, whereas those they always rally against are their strongest allies in freedom of expression.
